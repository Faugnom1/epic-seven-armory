• Full Hero lookup: search the entire Epic Seven catalog by name for their element, class, rarity, skills, etc.  
• Twitch extension: let viewers browse your pvp team's stats while you stream.  
• Google sign-in: log in with your Google account to keep your profile consistent.

### FAQ

Does OCR always get everything right?  
• Not always; fonts and effects can confuse OCR. Click any field to edit quickly.

What screenshots work best?  
• Full-resolution (e.g., 1920×1080), UI scale 100%, uncompressed PNG if possible.

Where do my images go?  
• Locally in your screenshots and hero_images folders. You control what you share.

Is my Google data safe?  
• Sign-in uses Google’s standard OAuth page. The app gets a token to identify you; it never sees your password.

ROADMAP / COMING SOON

• SIFT Draft Matcher integration (auto-detect 4 picks + banned unit on the post-ban screen)  
• Better OCR tuned for specific screens  
• Team builder and comparisons  
• Export packs for sharing to Discord/Twitter  

TROUBLESHOOTING

• OCR is wrong or blank → try a clearer screenshot, avoid motion blur, set UI scale to 100%, or crop tighter around the text and retry.  
• Can’t sign in → make sure your system clock is correct and pop-ups to Google’s sign-in page aren’t blocked.  
• Twitch extension not showing → re-link your Twitch account and ensure the extension is enabled on your channel’s dashboard.  

If you’re stuck, open an issue with a screenshot and a short description of what happened.
